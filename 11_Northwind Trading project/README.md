This project involved analyzing sales and order data for Northwind Traders, a fictional gourmet food supplier. The dataset included information on customers, products, orders, shippers, and employees. The goal of the project was to build a top-level Key Performance Indicator (KPI) dashboard to provide Northwind Traders' executives with a quick understanding of the company's performance in key areas.

2. Recognize and reward high-performing employee Margaret Peacock for her exceptional revenue generation.
3. Focus on new initiatives through the USA headquarters, leveraging the company's well-established presence in the region.
4. Increase the quantity of the highly profitable "Cote de Blaye" product and optimize shipping processing time to maximize profitability.
5. Gradually transition away from using United Package for shipping services and rely more on Federal Shipping and Speedy Express due to their shorter processing times and lower costs.
